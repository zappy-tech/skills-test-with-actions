# Test with Actions

_Create workflows that enable you to use Continuous Integration (CI) for your projects._

</header>

## Welcome

[Continuous integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) can help you stick to your teamâ€™s quality standards by running tests and reporting the results on GitHub. CI tools run builds and tests, triggered by commits and pull requests. Results are available on GitHub - for example, in pull requests. The goal is fewer issues in `main` and faster feedback as you work.

- **Who is this for**: Developers, DevOps Engineers, new GitHub users, students, teams.
- **What you'll learn**: What continuous integration is, how to use GitHub Actions for CI, how to create a workflow that runs tests and produces test reports.
- **What you'll build**: We'll use [remark-lint](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark-lint) to check the consistency of Markdown files.
- **Prerequisites**: We assume you've completed the [Hello GitHub Actions](https://github.com/skills/hello-github-actions) course first.
- **How long**: This course takes less than two hours to complete.

In this course, you will:

1. Add a test workflow
2. Fix the test
3. Upload a test report
4. Add branch protections
5. Merge your pull request

2. In the new tab, most of the prompts will automatically fill in for you.

   - Scroll down and click the **Create repository** button at the bottom of the form.
3. After your new repository is created, wait about 20 seconds, then refresh the page that displays the README in the new repository. The contents of the README will be replaced by instructions for step 1 of this course. Follow the instructions for "Step 1: Add a test workflow."
